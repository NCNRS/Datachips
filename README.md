# Datachips
Datachips are full text searchable collections of security data including blogs, documentation, writeups, and other sources. This repo contains a small list containing links to the sources of the data.

The actual full csv data can be found on our [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/NCNRS) dataset collections.  The `Datachips` service that runs on `Night City` uses a [tantivy](https://github.com/quickwit-oss/tantivy) instance to power a full text search of the datasets. 

In addition it's our hope that the datasets remain high quality and can be used in other applications such as in the devlopment of AI models.
